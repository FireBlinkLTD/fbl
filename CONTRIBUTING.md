# Contribution

Just follow few simple rules:

- Always create issue for any code change you have. Make sure to provide informative description.
- 100% test coverage, never go beyond that threshold.
- Write tests for the logic, not for the coverage report.
- Use `yarn commit` to commit your changes.
