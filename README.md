# Usage

Flexibility is the key concept of the FBL, so it can be used either as a command line tool, or integrated into any
existing Node.js app.

FBL by its own just provides a generally limited amount of embedded plugins and for real life usage may require 3rd party plugins.

## Requirements

- Node.js v8+ (earlier version may also work, but not supported officially)
