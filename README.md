# FBL or FireBlink Logistics

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/FireBlinkLTD/fbl.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This project is early in development and not recommended to even look at before version 0.1.0.

This is a second reincarnation on internal tool that FireBlink LTD used to deploy its own projects.
Original tool was vendor locked and had pretty much limited functionality.

The new one, README of which you're currently reading is redesigned from scratch to fix that limitation.
Even more, due to plugin nature it can process any kind of flows, even non related to deployments.

FBL generally designed to help with automation related tasks that require flexible control over the flow.

# Usage

Flexibility is the key concept of the FBL, so it can be used either as a command line tool, or integrated into any
existing Node.js app.

## CLI

`npm i -g fbl`
